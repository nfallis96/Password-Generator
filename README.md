## Projects Description
In this project, the purpose was to create an application that allows a user to generate a random password that satisfies a set of established requirements for length, letter case, number of characters, and special characters. This application had a starter code that included a simple HTML and CSS files, I worked on javascript to power the application in the browser and used functions, if/else if/else statements, and for loops.
